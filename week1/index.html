I consider myself a very outgoing person and usually tend to get along with everyone I come across. I hope to graduate one day, and I know I will through hard word and grit I want to be the best Cyber Engineer I could possibly be. I am enjoying my time here at NEIT and all the students and faculty here are very nice and helpful which is why I like attending this school.  </p>>
